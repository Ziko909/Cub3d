## Description
cub3D is a project inspired by the legendary game Wolfenstein 3D. It is a first-person perspective maze exploration game that utilizes ray-casting techniques to create a dynamic view inside the maze. The goal of the game is to navigate through the maze and find your way out.

## Bonus Part
The following additional features have been implemented in the bonus part of the project:

- **Minimap System:** The game includes a minimap that provides a top-down view of the maze. It helps the player navigate and keep track of their position within the maze.

- **Wall Collisions:** The game handles wall collisions, preventing the player from passing through walls. This adds realism to the gameplay and enforces the maze boundaries.

- **Rotate the Point of View with the Mouse:** This feature allows the player to rotate their point of view by moving the mouse. It provides a more immersive experience and enhances the gameplay controls.

## Usage

To build the project, run the following command in the project directory:

```
make
```

This will create the `cub3d` executable.

To run the game, run the following command in the project directory, specifying the path to the map file as the first argument:

```
./cub3d path/to/map.cub
```

For example, to run the game with the `map.cub` file in the `maps` directory, you would run the following command:

```
./cub3d maps/map.cub
```
